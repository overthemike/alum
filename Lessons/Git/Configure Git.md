It is important that you configure git with the email address that is
associated with your GitHub account. If you are not sure, check, then double
check.

What this command does is tell git that, when you track changes to your files,
those changes should be associated with you and your GitHub account.

```sh
git config --global user.email "<Your email>"
git config --global user.name "<Your name>"
```
