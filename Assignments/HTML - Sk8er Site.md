### Explore Mode

**Challenge #1.1:** Let's work on your layout skills! Recreate the web page from the mockup above. Place your HTML in a file called `index.html`, and your CSS in a file called `styles.css`. Any images you use should be placed in a `images` directory. You can choose your own images or crop them from the mockup in an image editor of your choice. 
**Goal #1.1:** Create the website as shown in the mockup image. 

**Challenge #1.2:** It's always good practice to add your projects to source control. Create a git repository for your code and add it to Github. 
**Goal #1.2:** Submit your Github URL below.

### Adventure Mode

**Challenge #2.1:** Modify your existing page so that the design is responsive across a wide range of screens. How the page scales is up to you, but make sure that everything still works as intended even at small widths. Don't forget to update your Github with the responsive design!
**Goal #2.1:** Submit your updated Github URL below.
